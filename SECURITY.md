# Security Guidelines for AttendEase

## Environment Variables Security

### Required Variables
- `JWT_SECRET`: Use a cryptographically secure random string (minimum 32 characters)
- `BCRYPT_ROUNDS`: Use 12 or higher for production
- `NODE_ENV`: Set to 'production' for production deployment

### Browser Security
- `HEADLESS_BROWSER`: Keep as 'true' in production for security
- `BROWSER_TIMEOUT`: Set reasonable timeouts to prevent hanging processes

## Rate Limiting

### Login Protection
- Maximum 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Temporary account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- CAPTCHA integration recommended for production

### Attendance Fetching
- Maximum 3 attendance fetch requests per 10 minutes per user
- Queue system for high-traffic scenarios

## Data Security

### Credential Handling
- Credentials are NEVER stored on the server
- Passwords are used only for immediate portal authentication
- JWT tokens are used for session management
- All API requests are authenticated and validated

### Network Security
- HTTPS mandatory for production
- CORS configured for specific domains only
- Request sanitization and validation
- SQL injection prevention (though no SQL database is used)

## Browser Security

### Puppeteer Configuration
- Sandboxed browser execution
- No persistent browser data storage
- Automatic cleanup of browser instances
- Memory leak prevention

### Portal Interaction
- Minimal data extraction
- No sensitive data logging
- Secure cookie handling
- Proper session termination

## Error Handling

### Security Error Responses
- Generic error messages to prevent information leakage
- Detailed logs server-side only
- No stack traces in production responses
- Rate limiting on error endpoints

### Logging Security
- No credential logging
- Sanitized error logs
- IP address logging for security monitoring
- Audit trail for administrative actions

## Production Deployment Checklist

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
   - [ ] Configure secure JWT_SECRET
   - [ ] Set appropriate timeouts
   - [ ] Configure CORS for production domains

2. **Security Headers**
   - [ ] Enable Helmet.js security headers
   - [ ] Configure CSP (Content Security Policy)
   - [ ] Set secure cookie flags
   - [ ] Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

3. **Network Security**
   - [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS certificates
   - [ ] Configure firewall rules
   - [ ] Set up reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
   - [ ] Enable DDoS protection

4. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
   - [ ] Configure log aggregation
   - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
   - [ ] Enable security scanning

5. **Browser Security**
   - [ ] Run browsers in containers if possible
   - [ ] Set resource limits
   - [ ] Configure proper cleanup
   - [ ] Monitor browser processes

## Security Best Practices

### Code Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Output sanitization
- Dependency security scanning
- Regular security updates

### Infrastructure Security
- Container isolation
- Resource limits
- Process monitoring
- Automatic restarts

### Compliance
- No persistent storage of personal data
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data retention policies
- Privacy policy compliance

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling
1. Immediate containment
2. Impact assessment
3. Evidence collection
4. System recovery
5. Post-incident review

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Failed login attempt monitoring
- Unusual traffic pattern detection
- Error rate monitoring
- Resource usage alerts

## Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Review error logs
- [ ] Check failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Update dependencies

### Monthly
- [ ] Security scan
- [ ] Review access logs
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Test backup procedures

### Quarterly
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Review security policies
- [ ] Update incident response plan
